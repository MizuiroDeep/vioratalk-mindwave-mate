# VioraTalk Architecture Overview

## System Design

VioraTalk follows a modular, event-driven architecture that separates concerns into distinct layers. The system is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and performance.

## Core Components

### 1. Core Layer (`src/vioratalk/core/`)
- **VioraTalkEngine**: Central orchestrator managing all components
- **DialogueManager**: Controls conversation flow and state
- **Character System**: Manages personality profiles and behaviors
- **Memory Manager**: Handles conversation history and context

### 2. Engine Layer
- **STT Engine**: Speech-to-Text processing (multiple providers)
- **LLM Engine**: Language model integration (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Ollama)
- **TTS Engine**: Text-to-Speech synthesis with emotion support

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (`src/vioratalk/infrastructure/`)
- **Audio System**: Microphone capture and speaker output
- **Network Manager**: API communication and connection handling
- **Security Manager**: API key storage and encryption
- **Performance Monitor**: Resource usage tracking

### 4. UI Layer
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for development
- **GUI Interface**: Desktop application (PySide6-based)

## Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- UI layer contains no business logic
- Core layer is UI-agnostic
- Infrastructure handles all external dependencies

### Dependency Direction
- Dependencies flow inward: UI → Core → Infrastructure
- No circular dependencies allowed
- Interfaces define contracts between layers

### Extensibility
- Plugin system for adding new features
- Strategy pattern for engine implementations
- Event-driven communication between components

## Data Flow

1. User speaks → Audio capture
2. STT processes audio → Text
3. DialogueManager processes text → Context
4. LLM generates response → Text
5. TTS synthesizes speech → Audio
6. Audio plays to user

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: PySide6 (GUI), asyncio (async operations)
- **Dependencies**: Managed via Poetry
- **Testing**: pytest, unittest.mock
- **Quality**: Black, isort, mypy, flake8

## Future Considerations

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements including:
- Real-time streaming capabilities
- Multi-character conversations
- Advanced emotion recognition
- Cloud synchronization
- Mobile companion apps
